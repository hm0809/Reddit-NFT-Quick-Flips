<h1>ROADMAP</h1>
```html
<ol>

    <li>Acquire an Opensea API key: This will allow our tool to access the necessary data from the Opensea platform.
    </li>
    <li>Gather and store data: Our tool will need to regularly retrieve data on listings, sales, and trends in the "Reddit Collectible Avatar" opensea collections market. This data will be stored in a database for analysis.
    </li>
    <li>Analyze data: Our tool will use algorithms to analyze the stored data and identify abnormal trends or opportunities for profit.
    </li>
    <li>Notify users: When abnormal trends or profit opportunities are identified, our tool will send notifications to users through various notification systems (e.g. email, SMS, desktop, iOS, Android).
    </li>
    <li>User action: Users can then use the insights provided by our tool to make informed decisions about their collectibles and potentially resell them at a higher value.
    </li>
    <li>Continual data gathering and analysis: This process will be ongoing, with the tool continually gathering and analyzing data to identify new trends and opportunities for users.
    </li>
</ol>
