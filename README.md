<h1>ROADMAP</h1>



1. Acquire an Opensea API key: This will allow our tool to access the necessary data from the Opensea platform.

2. Gather and store data: Our tool will need to regularly retrieve data on listings, sales, and trends in the "Reddit Collectible Avatar" opensea collections market. This data will be stored in a database for analysis.

3. Analyze data: Our tool will use algorithms to analyze the stored data and identify abnormal trends or opportunities for profit.

4. Notify users: When abnormal trends or profit opportunities are identified, our tool will send notifications to users through various notification systems (e.g. email, SMS, desktop, iOS, Android).

5. User action: Users can then use the insights provided by our tool to make informed decisions about their collectibles and potentially resell them at a higher value.

6. Continual data gathering and analysis: This process will be ongoing, with the tool continually gathering and analyzing data to identify new trends and opportunities for users.
